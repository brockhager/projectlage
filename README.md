Coordination of a public world address for planet earth stored on a public blockchain. 

Imagine a global address standardizer that normally has many IDs across many systems. 

Generate a public key that is the permanent identifier for that one location on Earth. 

There are many sources of where address and location data is stored. We can pull from public APIs and get all of the data into one public blockchain that anyone can pull from.  Since it is a blockchain, it can be read from throughout the entire world and no one controls it. There will be certain data standards that will be put in place prior to the first set of data being written to the blockchain.  This will reduce errors that occur during the processing of data into the blockchain.
